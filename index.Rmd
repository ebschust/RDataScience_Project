# Introduction
Taxonomy is the method by which organisms are assigned to a genus and species group. It is a science that is constantly evolving due to our growing knowledge of a group of organisms. This is especially true of graptolite taxonomy. Early work with graptolites focused solely on naming graptolites for use in biostratigraphy, meaning that graptolites were loosely grouped based on their general appearance instead of evolutionary or trait based backing. As studies into the evolution in graptolite morphology, or genetics based traits increased, there was an increasing realization that synonymies, or the same type of organism with different taxonomic names, existed. Through carefully examination of graptolite literature these synonyms are slowly being identified (Mitchell et. al, unpublished data). However, the presence of synonyms may not only be due to changes in graptolite research through time. These synonyms may be geographically located either due to a cultural preference for generating new species or a tectonically strained region where morphology is more difficult to constrain. It may also be that particular authors were more likely to generate new species names due to a variety of factors.  
This research will attempt to examine any correlation by first mapping the presence of graptolites that both with and without synonyms on a world map to visually determine locations with more synonymies. This map will then be animated such that the graptolite locations will plot based upon the year that they were named. If there is a temporal correlation to synonymies, more synonyms should plot within a given time frame than others. Finally, the graptolites with synonyms will be grouped by the original naming author with the number of individual species summed per author to determine if there is an author based correlation.


# Materials and methods

The presence of graptolite synonymies may be correlated to a number of factors including time, cultural or tectonic location, and author. The project will combine data on synonymies, contained within the Taxonomic Dictionary (Mitchell et. al., unpublished data), with graptolite locatlity information, complied as section data (Mitchell et. al., unpublished data). This will be used to:

1. Examine geographic distribution of graptolites with synonymies compared to graptolites without synonymies
2. Examine temporal distribution of both groupings of graptolites
3. Determine relationship of number of synonymies related to naming author.

Intially, the required packages will need to be loaded (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(sp)
library(rgeos)
library(maptools)
library(ggplot2)
```

The data is contained in two comma separated files (CSV) that will need to be loaded into Rstudio from the working directory. As such, it is important to make sure that the working directory contains both the Taxonomic Dictionary and the section data.
```{r}
#Load Taxonomic Dictionary

myDict=read.csv("data/Taxonomic dictionary Oct3'17_mod.csv",header=T,sep=",")

#Load section data

mySect=read.csv("data/sections_table format.csv", header=T, sep =",")
```
(There seems to be an error in loading the CSV files. It works fine from a script in Rstudio but will not work from the RMD file even if the working directory is properly set. Unsure how to rectify this problem.)


After loading both CSV files, the section data and the Taxonomic Dictionary must be joined so that all the geographic locations are paired with the correct taxonomic information including the presence of senior synonyms. This data is then filtered by the senior synonym column in order to generate a list that contains only graptolite locations with named senior synonyms.
```{r}
#Join the sections data and the graptolite dictionary
Grap_locate=full_join(mySect,myDict,by="GRCode")

#Generate synonoym list
synGrap_locate=filter(Grap_locate, senior.synonym!="*" & senior.synonym!=99999)
```

These two data sets are then visually compared by overlapping the synonyms list over all of the graptolite locations on a world map.
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating graptolite locations"}
#Load a world map
library(ggmap)
library(maptools)
library(maps)

worldmap=borders("world",colour="gray50",fill="white")

#plot points on world map
mapWorld=ggplot()+worldmap

mapWorld+
  geom_point(data=Grap_locate,aes(x=Longitude,y=Latitude),col="red",show.legend=NA)+
  geom_point(data=synGrap_locate,aes(x=Longitude,y=Latitude),col="blue",show.legend=NA)+
  coord_equal()
```
Areas that contain only red points indicate locations were there are no graptolite synonymies.

Further coding will result in an animation of the above plotted points in relation to the year that the species was named. The graptolite synonymies will also be grouped by author and summed then compared to random grouping by author to determine if there is a significant correlation.
